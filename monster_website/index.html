        <!-- <h1>Fantasy Ruby Red</h1> -->
        <h2>This is one of the last flavors I have tried. I honestly don't dig it. Maybe its because I have had so many energy drinks that my taste buds are totally singed, but nothing really stands out about this one.</h2>

        <!-- <h1>Ultra Blue</h1> -->
        <h2>I had a decent amount of difficulty trying to find this flavor. Can color is great, however this is just meh. This is dumb but, I wish there was more artificial blue. I expected some crazy blue raz concoction, not just some mild blueberry flavor</h2>

        <!-- <h1>Ultra Fiesta Mango</h1> -->
        <h2>I go back and forth on this flavor. The mango rly hits u in between the eyes and it has the same feeling of electricty as mcdonalds sprite. I used to drink it all the name because it was one of the only flavors netto sold and I would drink it during game design class with Caroline and Vahn. We would split the giant 32 oz can or something. </h2>

        <!-- <h1>Ultra Gold</h1> -->
        <h2>Tastes like how I imagine redbull would taste. Doesn't taste like good monster. (Note after trying redbull) This does not taste like redbull. It is very different. (After a retasting) This kinda tastes how I imagine ichor would taste if it is was mid (shrug emoji)</h2>

        <!-- <h1>Ultra Paradise</h1> -->
        <h2>Super pungent green apple, not much sugary after taste. Could have a bit more green apple, tastes like flavored glowstick</h2>

        <!-- <h1>Ultra Red</h1> -->
        <h2>Cant place the flavor for the taste, gets tiring rather quickly. It's like strawberry cherry cough syrup. It is a lil too red for me</h2>

        <!-- <h1>Ultra Rosa</h1> -->
        <h2>This one certainly does not taste like rose, but it is not too shabby. I am drinking this on my way to Mt. Auburn so it will always be a memory that is branded in my brain</h2>

        <!-- <h1>Ultra Sunrise</h1> -->
        <h2>Like fanta but better, not a terrible mouth feel, but leaves a sugary feeling on back of the tongue. I really enjoy this flavor and will always drink it. Maybe that's because it is one of the more disctinct flavors, where it is just orange and not a bunch of fruit podge</h2>

        <!-- <h1>Ultra Vice Guava</h1> -->
        <h2>This reminds me of pipeline punch, but sugar free of course. The mouth feel is a little unsettling but maybe it's because I haven't drank monster in a while.</h2>

        <!-- <h1>Ultra Watermelon</h1> -->
        <h2>The watermelon flavor is true to watermelon, which I enjoy but also I don't like artificial watermelon so it gets a few points off for that. This is one of the first monsters I ever drank. I drank it because I was falling asleep playing pool with Ryan at 3 am so we added drinking a monster to our wager. It helped me out and I was on a winning streak until I fell asleep.</h2>

        <!-- <h1>Zero Ultra</h1> -->
        <h2>Heres the thing: this is the absolute classic Standard monster flavor. However, what naturally occuring substance was in mind when this was created? Has a little bit of sugary feeling on the back of the tongue.</h2>
