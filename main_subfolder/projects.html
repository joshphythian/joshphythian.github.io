<p>Hi! THIS WEBSITE IS NOT DONE SO SORRY!!! It should be ready by the end of 6/30. I used to host my website at <a href="https://joshphythian.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/">https://joshphythian.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/</a></p>
<p>This hosting was done through my school account, but Wesleyan ends website support soon, so I had to migrate my website to a new domain and have run into administrative issues.</p>
<p>When I try to access the dashboard for my old website, I get an error saying to contact an administrator so I am starting from scratch. SO SORRY!!!!.</p>
<p>I have more current projects too and will upload them soon!</p>

                <p>I wanted to try some more web design stuff and I have a ranking of most monster zero flavors, so I made this. First I tried webscraping the monster page to get images, but they had an anti scraping protocol, so I just tediously downloaded them all. Next I used PIL to pick the font and can color for each can, and add that to a dictionary with my ranking for the flavor. Then I used the dictionary to create the images seen in the background. Then I used scroll trigger to implement some animations. </p>

                <a href="/celsius_website/index.html" target="_blank">Celsius Energy Drink Ranking</a>
                <p>I wanted to explore some basic web design, webscraping and put my rankings for each celsius flavor somewhere. After a lot of selenium and bs4 testing, I could not get past the captchas to get images for all the celsius, so I had to download them all manually, hence the uneven sizing across the images.

                <!--<br>-->
                <!--    Why is it that you have to scroll through the whole thing?-->
                <!--    I like how that feels and the ranking doesn't really matter, cuz if you are gonna drink a celsius I would reccomend fantasy vibe or any other flavor cuz they all kinda taste the same. -->

                <p>Explore my work on analyzing sectors and running models. To use this: input a correlation matrix from applying cpptraj on an MD output and the corresponding pdb file. I used flask to just make a simple webpage and connect it to my python code for sector identification.</p>

                <p>A game where you guess if a word has germanic or latin roots. A friend was playing this game using wikipedia, and I thought, that wouldn't be too hard to automate. I wanted to use the wikipedia API and request a random term each time, but it was just kinda easier to scrape wikipedia, then make a table using the scraped data, and randomly pick a term from that table. I may add another gamemode soon.

                <p>
                    I am so close to this working. I wanted to use js_of_ocaml to turn my evalutaor in ocaml to byte code and then turn that into js, but it has been more tedious than I thought. I am having errors where the js file is not recognizing the functions that were in the ocaml file. Currently trying a new approach using Dream.

                    This is an escape room about a musician who has to get his life back together and write some music . It was my first time using git and unity together. Also it is not designed to be played on the web so it is a little glitchy.

                   I want to experiment with some more web design effects<br>
                   <strong> Online tic tac toe </strong><br>
                   I am currently integrating this with AWS. So far I have a build with flask for the backend and react for the frontend. I am also working on turning an AI TicTacToe player that I wrote in SML to a playable bot.

                   <strong>Hiking Map</strong>
                   <br>
                   This will be an interactive map where as you scroll down, it will follow an svg path projected onto a hiking map and at various points there will be a panorama I have taken while walking on that trail.
